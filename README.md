# DeckTracker
A side project that I have been working on. It is an android app where the user enters their decks and the decks that they face. 
This is saved to a database on the phone. The app keeps track of the win/loss ratio of each deck and how often a deck is faced. 
It will then recomend one of the users decks based upon which deck has the highest win/loss ratio against the most common faced deck.
